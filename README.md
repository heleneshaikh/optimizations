# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

As part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree, our challenge was to optimize a website with the knowledge we gained from the videos.

### Getting started
To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code. You can also visit https://heleneshaikh.github.io/optimizations/index.html

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
By compressing the images and increasing the speed in total by adapting the css, html, and js, I was able to achieve high scores on Google Page Insights.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html
Refactored the code in main.js due to a lot of "jank" and "forced syncronized layouts". Check the console and you will see that the pizza slider responds quite quickly.
Scrolling is also optimized and the values can be consulted in the console.
You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
